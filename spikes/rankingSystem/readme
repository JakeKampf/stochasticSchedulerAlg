The purpose of this spike is to test a ranking system to see what threshholds are appropriate for a point based ranking system.

The criteria for the ranking system are as follows:
Not too many classes in a day
Minimize transitions between parkview and main campus in a day
Not too many late classes
Not too much of a gap between classes (excluding travel time)
No back to back to back classes
